From Data Analyst to Cloud Developer 🌐

Three weeks ago, I started building my portfolio website. Today, I'm proud to share the result of countless hours of learning, debugging, and building!

💡 The Challenge:
I didn't want a template. I wanted to build something that truly represents my skills as a Data Analyst AND my ability to learn new technologies.

🛠️ The Solution:
Built a serverless web application from scratch:
• Frontend: Clean HTML/CSS/JS with smooth animations
• Backend: AWS Lambda (Node.js 22) for contact form
• Infrastructure: S3 hosting, API Gateway, Amazon SES
• Monitoring: CloudWatch for logging and analytics

📊 What's Inside:
✅ Employee Retention Analysis dashboard
✅ E-commerce data insights (100K+ orders analyzed)
✅ AI/ML projects with 89% accuracy
✅ Automation tools reducing manual work by 80%
✅ Interactive Power BI & Tableau visualizations

🎯 Key Learnings:
1. Serverless architecture is powerful and cost-effective (<$1/month!)
2. Data skills translate beautifully to technical problem-solving
3. Documentation is as important as the code itself
4. AWS ecosystem is incredibly versatile
